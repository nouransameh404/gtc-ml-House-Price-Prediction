 **House Price Prediction**

The goal is to build a simple machine learning model that can predict **California house prices**.

**Files in repository**
- `HousePricePrediction.ipynb` → Jupyter/Colab notebook with my code and steps.  
- `housing.csv` → Dataset used for training and testing the model.  

**Steps**
1. Loaded the dataset (`housing.csv`).  
2. Did some data exploration (checking missing values, statistics, etc.).  
3. Preprocessed the data (handled missing values, converted categories, etc.).  
4. Built a machine learning model to predict house prices.  
5. Evaluated the model performance.  

**Tools**
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)  

**How to run**
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the cells step by step to see the process and results.
 
✨ This is **beginner practice** for understanding machine learning basics.
